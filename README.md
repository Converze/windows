# Windöws

*Windöws* is a lightweight framework around the [Windows API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh920508.aspx), for Windows Vista and above.

This library has been developed solely for the needs of a single desktop application, therefore it is far from being feature complete. Its name has an umlaut, because, why nöt?

For seriouser applications, please use a seriouser library such as [Win32++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32-framework/) or [WTL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/). Better yet, as a wise person once said:

> I swear I'm going to give up Win32 programming after this!
